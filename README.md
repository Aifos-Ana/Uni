# Uni Calendar - Flutter Integration for FEUP Students

## Product Vision:

For university students who need to stay informed and organized, Uni Calendar is a mini-app that provides easy access to all university-related dates. Unlike Sigarra, our solution allows users to find the information they need in just a few clicks.

## Main Features:

- **Events Calendar:** Displays all relevant university events in a structured format.

- **Scholar Calendar:** Provides access to academic schedules, holidays, and key dates.

- **Notifications:** Sends reminders and important updates directly to students.

- **Personal Calendar Synchronization:** Allows users to sync their personal calendars for a unified view of their schedule.

## Assumptions and Dependencies:

- **Events API from Sigarra:** The app fetches event details directly from the university’s Sigarra system.

- **School Calendar API from Sigarra:** Official academic dates and schedules are sourced from the university’s system to ensure accuracy.

## Technology Stack:

- **Dart & Flutter:** The app is built using Flutter for cross-platform compatibility.

- **API Integration:** Uses Sigarra’s APIs to fetch real-time data.

- **Firebase or Local Storage:** For storing user preferences and notifications.
